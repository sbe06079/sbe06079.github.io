567 days in the 7th infantry division in the korean army, the closest to the border between south and north korea.

it was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life. i was comfortable as a neither-korean-nor-american nobody in the states, as i had still spent half of my life in the states when i had entered the army. i felt somewhat alien in the korean army as well, even by the time i was done with my service, but regardless -- i learned so so much during the four gap semesters (i went after freshmen year), so much more than i could have ever imagined, and the brotherhood i gained has not faded.

my time in the army was a big blur -- a great learning moment that still is sticking with me to this day.
