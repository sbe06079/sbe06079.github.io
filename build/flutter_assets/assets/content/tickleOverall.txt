I got so so lucky. This was my first internship as a college student.

At the time, I wanted to become an investment banker someday, and I desperately needed a "finance internship". I got rejected by 30+ places. My "last" resort was to apply to a few fintech startups, given that fintech "felt like finance".

In the end, I ended up joining a then-three-people team that was a couple of months before beta launch in Korea and met the best group of people, all of whom turned out to be so inspirational, hardworking, and knowledgeable. A lot of my peers that did a freshman summer internship often say that the experience was overall "not bad". I am so thankful I got to be at Tickle for four months and to have met the CTO, with whom I still keep in touch.
