i gained the habit to constantly deny my assumptions until i've confirmed them. i had the opportunity to live, train, work, perform (i played baritone saxophone in the army band), sleep, and even argue with people from all types of background. seriously, "all". the korean army is mandatory for all able korean male citizens, so i really got to meet people that are from backgrounds i hadn't learnt of.

it was lovely. all the assumptions i had on what was "normal", "sensical", "cool", or even "sad" were broken so many times through living with these comrades or talking with these comrades, oftentimes 1 vs 1 during our 2-4am night shifts somewhere up in the mountains with nothing but pitch-black darkness, our guns, and our stories.

this experience has allowed me to never believe that i am "right" to start with, because i am starting with my own assumptions, which aren't always "right" to someone else as well. not that i triple-check and annoy people, but i think i do carry this mindset with me such that whenever i have to get on the same page with someone (project, work, really anything), i make sure half the job is me understanding thier assumptions and not explaining mine.
