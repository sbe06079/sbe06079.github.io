keeping track of "stuff".

i never realized how important it was until i worked at Tickle, which went from four people to seven by the time i left. purely because of my ocd that i've had had (and still do) for years, i just happened to be the one that kept track of all sorts of things (company's logins, emails, important contacts, who said what on which iteration of the product when, etc.) simply for my mental pleasure, but it ended up paying off at a few minor moments for the company. and i am so glad to have been helpful in that way to the team.

from Tickle, i later got the idea to keep track of all important professional contacts in a personal Excel spreadsheet, and it's been paying off at many critical points of my personal life.
