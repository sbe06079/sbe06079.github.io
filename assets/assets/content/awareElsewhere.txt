coincidentally, the guy that reached out to me to join Aware as #2 consistently writes one of the most intriguing pieces on the markets.

i was definitely interested in finance before joining Aware, but during my time at Aware, i learned so much abt the markets, and that interest stuck with me, so much so that i wanted to try to apply to opportunities that involve the markets later down the road.
