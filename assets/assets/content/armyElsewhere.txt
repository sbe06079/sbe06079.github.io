All lessons and habits gained aside, it's the people i met there.

They're helping me all throughout. I still get crazy feedback and advice from one of the best singers and musicians I've met. I still get to relatively escape boredom when I'm in korea or even in the states as I get to reconnect with my comrades (they're all amazing people doing their own great things). Majority of them are older than me, so it'd be an understatement to say I learn or gain wisdom from them to this day, sometimes without even them knowing about it.
