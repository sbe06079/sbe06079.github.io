all lessons and habits gained aside, it's the people i met there.

they're helping me all throughout. i still get crazy feedback and advice from one of the best singers and musicians i've met. i still get to relatively escape boredom when i'm in korea or even in the states as i get to reconnect with my comrades (they're all amazing people doing their own great things). majority of them are older than me, so it'd be an understatement to say i learn or gain wisdom from them to this day, sometimes without even them knowing abt it.
