i got so so lucky. this was my first internship as a college student.

at the time, i wanted to become an investment banker someday, and i desperately needed a "finance internship". i got rejected by 30+ places. my "last" resort was to apply to a few fintech startups, given that fintech "felt like finance".

in the end, i ended up joining a then-three-people team that was a couple months before beta launch in korea and met the best group of people, all of whom turned out to be so inspirational, hard working, and knowledgeable. a lot of my peers that did a freshman summer internship often say that the experience was overall "not bad". i am so thankful i got to be at tickle for four months and to have met the cto, with whom i still keep in touch.
