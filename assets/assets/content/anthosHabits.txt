After working at Anthos, I think the single biggest habit I gained was to read emails. duh, like everyone should...

At Anthos, both for my work for the Insights team and for sourcing potential companies as part of the job, I found myself in a situation where I was no longer following or reading up on a specific topic or market (i.e. coca-cola stock), but I had to make sure I get "exposed" to as many recent ideas and trends as possible.

With that, I can either choose to further deep-dive into a trend that may be VC-related-or-helpful, or, as an intern, I can discuss what I read with someone at the firm that has a better knowledge and career background in it (i.e. plant-based milk consumer trends in the States)

With the goal to gain the ability to absorb lots of information in mind, because I had learned during my time at Aware that I learn the best via emails, I signed up for hundreds of newsletters (some from media companies, others from individuals), most of which I am still subscribed to today.

That got super overwhelming real fast, but a couple weeks into the internship, I got into the habit of speed-browsing all the newsletters I get in the morning. I would read thoroughly for some that really stood out to me, and because that is physically impossible to do for the 40-ish emails that are unread by the time I wake up, for most of them, I would make it a goal to read at least one paragraph or blurb in an email thoroughly before I open, read, and delete that email.
