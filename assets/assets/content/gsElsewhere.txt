definitely the ability to think in the morning clearer and faster than i used to be able to. back at duke for senior year, i now am able to wake up in ten minutes (no snoozing!) and go straight to work or exercise or thinking about an email in the first twenty minutes of the day.

the other thing is that i have a bit more confidence talking to "strangers", given the number of people (hundreds) at the firm i had to introduce myself and attempt to build a relationship over the course of the internship.
