It's always the obvious lesson that gets me. Operating a startup, in the early stages, is incredibly difficult.

That isn't to say it is impossible, but after the overall experience, I learned that I want to do my own company full-time at some point. It was hard, but it was just all fun and fun and fun.

My time at Aware made me want to work with other people (both as a founder and many more times as just an employee) at amazing workplace/settings as much as possible. Only then, personally, would I feel confident that (assuming a good idea) I can turn an early stage team into a real impact that would last.
