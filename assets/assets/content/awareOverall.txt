Aware was a financial education platform (a mix of Investopedia and Medium) for South Korean retail investors. It started with one financial blogger in Korea with a great following (and great insights!), I joined as #2 to the startup and worked on the idea-to-post-launch stage sort of as the PM guy, and by the time I left the startup, we were at a team of five.

It was my first attempt at a startup full-time (I worked on this pretty much full-time between when I was almost done with my army service till when I returned to Duke as a full-time student), after an incredible first startup experience as intern at Tickle. The type of work ethic, passion, and hunger for growth (for the product and myself), till this day, I'd say are one of the crucial pieces that make up the foundations to why I do things a certain way.

For the majority of my time at Aware, the team was just myself and that financial blogger. We were lean - we both worked on making our business plan, pitch deck (ended up raising seed!), designing, website making, product developing, etc. Working full-time at Aware definitely had its ups and downs (as one does when owning and operating a startup), but it was nonetheless one of my favorite products to have worked on.
