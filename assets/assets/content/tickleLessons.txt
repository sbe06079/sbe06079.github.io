I learned how important it is, especially at the early stage of a company with few people, to stay calm consistently even throughout the tough moments that require heavy discussion and perhaps arguments.

Everyone at the company was not only logical but also mature and wise in how they express and fine-tune opinions. I really miss that work environment (not that it's not like that at all elsewhere), and it is something I look back often in my thoughts.
