I learned to (and am still learning) how to write effective notes.

When the company was only two people, it was serious loads of texting back and forth files, ideas, progress updates, etc. Of course, a lot of the communication was done remotely (and not in-person) by virtue of both of us working constantly, and one of the ongoing internal challenges I had put on myself was: "How can I make sure my message here is effective in a way that there is no room for miscommunication and at the same time ensures that my colleague read, and I mean truly read, everything in that message?"

This isn't to blame my co-founder, but rather, there were many moments and messages in hindsight where there was so much I wanted to say but not a whole lot of it got conveyed correctly, which led to multiple iterations, re-designs, re-meetings, etc. That did made me want to make it a long-term goal to become an effective communicator. Fast forward a few years, during my summer at Goldman Sachs, my mentor, as I finished up the internship, recommended a book called "Smart Brevity", and it was amazing. I wish I had read it earlier!
