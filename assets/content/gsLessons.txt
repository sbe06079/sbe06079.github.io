I guess one huge lesson I learned (and the only one I'd like to record here) is that consistency brings in opportunities. There were moments throughout the summer when I felt like I wasn't getting direct "return" on how hard I was trying to stay consistent. (Coming in early or energized, doing my daily tasks with not much fluctuations in quality, etc.) I was not aiming for consistency for the hope that someone would notice me, but rather purely because I felt that I was not as knowledgeable and experienced in the markets as I wanted to be."

Soon, though, as I kept steady and consistent, opportunities started showing because I had started to build a network that was willing to guide me to resources and I became ready to take on those opportunities and challenges.
