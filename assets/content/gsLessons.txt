i guess one huge lesson i learned (and the only one i'd like to record here) is that consistency brings in opportunities. there were moments throughout the summer when i felt like i wasn't getting direct "return" on how hard i was trying to stay consistent. (coming in early or energized, doing my daily tasks with not much fluctuations in quality, etc.) i was not aiming for consistency for the hope that someone would notice me, but rather purely because i felt that i was not as knowledgeable and experienced in the markets as i wanted to be."

soon, though, as i kept steady and consistent, opportunities started showing because i had started to build a network that was willing to guide me to resources and i became ready to take on those opportunities and challenges.
