with every detail. I like this way of thinking because I'm a huge believer in "life is unpredictable", so the best you can do is worry into the future, only as far as you're capable of evaluating, sort of like driving at midnight in pitch black with your high beams on - you have high certainty of the world that's a few yards ahead of you, but nothing beyond that.

Another habit that I gained that I'm truly thankful for is waking up early. Sure, my 18 months in the Korean army helped me wake up at 6:30am every morning, but that was when there was forced morning routine forced upon me. Every morning, the squad would have to wear our uniforms, clean up our bed and ourselves, stand in formation outside, and sing the national anthem, and it would only be the fifteenth minute of my day. Especially going to work every morning to the interest rates product group the first half of the summer (and me being an intern), I woke up at 4am at the latest every morning and was able to exercise most of my mental capacity by 7am, and I am very glad that I was able to gain that discipline and skill.
