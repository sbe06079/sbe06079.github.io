too many haha. the biggest one, though, is that health drives success. it's so obvious looking back, but before the army, i used to be one thinking that i could pull all-nighters and push through tough times and hours limitlessly.

turns out, my limits were tested many times in the army, and if i do not have the fundamental physical health (or the management of it), the ceiling is as low as it gets. i was sick multiple times in the army, even had surgery - there were moments when i thought 'wait a minute isn't life going to get even harder than times in the army if i choose a hard life? and i've already hit my ceiling?'

so, as obvious as it is, i've learned to take care of my physical and mental health as a habit, out of necessity. i'm sure it's something i would've learned at some point, and i'm glad i learned it in the army before i return to sophomore year and the rest of adulthood.
