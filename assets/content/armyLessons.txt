Too many haha. The biggest one, though, is that health drives success. It's so obvious looking back, but before the army, I used to be one thinking that I could pull all-nighters and push through tough times and hours limitlessly.

Turns out, my limits were tested many times in the army, and if I do not have the fundamental physical health (or the management of it), the ceiling is as low as it gets. I was sick multiple times in the army, even had surgery - there were moments when I thought 'wait a minute isn't life going to get even harder than times in the army if I choose a hard life? And I've already hit my ceiling?'

So, as obvious as it is, I've learned to take care of my physical and mental health as a habit, out of necessity. I'm sure it's something I would've learned at some point, and I'm glad I learned it in the army before I return to sophomore year and the rest of adulthood.
