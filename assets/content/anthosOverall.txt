the summer after my sophomore year, i got super lucky to be doing an internship at Anthos Capital, an opportunistic, stage-agnostic VC firm based in Santa Monica, California.

i worked in the Insights team with another intern (so two interns total), and overall, vc and startup knowledge aside, i learned so much about how to think and analyze. the job wasn't necessarily 100% sourcing and modeling (which was my expectation prior to starting the internship) - rather, because i had the unqiue opportunity to be on the Insights team, a lot of the work was in identifying and defining "trends" that may or may not be directly vc-related.

one of the most memorable projects i did that summer was one on consumer social / internet. because my direct manager was a tech veteran at so many different places (one of which is snapchat), i learned so many different angles to approach an identifiabe pattern or trend in that industry. this was my first internship at a "firm" (rather than a startup), and i am very fortunate to have met an amazing mentor and to learn about the firms' founders' inspiring journeys.
