after working at Anthos, i think the single biggest habit i gained was to read emails. duh, like everyone should...

at Anthos, both for my work for the Insights team and for sourcing potential companies as part of the job, i found myself in a situation where i was no longer following or reading up on a specific topic or market (i.e. coca-cola stock), but i had to make sure i get "exposed" to as many recent ideas and trends as possible.

with that, i can either choose to further deep-dive into a trend that may be VC-related-or-helpful, or, as an intern, i can discuss what i read with someone at the firm that has a better knowledge and career background in it (i.e. plant-based milk consumer trends in the States)

with the goal to gain the ability to absorb lots of information in mind, because i had learned during my time at Aware that i learn the best via emails, i signed up for hundreds of newsletters (some from media companies, others from individuals), most of which i am still subscribed to today.

that got super overwhelming real fast, but a couple weeks into the internship, i got into the habit of speed-browsing all the newsletters i get in the morning. i would read thoroughly for some that really stood out to me, and because that is physically impossible to do for the 40-ish emails that are unread by the time i wake up, for most of them, i would make it a goal to read at least one paragraph or blurb in an email thoroughly before i open, read, and delete that email.
